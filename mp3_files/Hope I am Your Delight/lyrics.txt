Come Lord Jesus Come
Please Hear my Voice and Rescue Me
Come Lord Jesus Come
I pray you won't Tarry
You make the Sun rise in the morning
You make the Moon reflect your light
You make the wind blow and give a breeze
that makes it a delight
You let the Birds chirp in the morning
You open your hands and make things right
You are my God and I just thank you 
and I hope that I am your delight
Come Lord Jesus Come
Please Hear my Voice and Rescue Me
Come Lord Jesus Come
I pray you won't Tarry
You make the Sun rise in the morning
You make the Moon reflect your light
You make the wind blow and give a breeze
that makes it a delight
You let the Birds chirp in the morning
You open your hands and make things right
You are my God and I just thank you 
and I hope that I am your delight
