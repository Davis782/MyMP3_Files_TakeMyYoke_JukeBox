I heard you say 
Take my Yoke upon you 
it is Easy,
But when I look around
everything seems to be hard
Then you said if you learn of me
you will understand
You have Eternal Life 
Be Still and Know I'm God
You see I chose before Foundations of the world Child
Everything is under My control
When you take upon my Yoke
and learn of me
You understand that You will not grow Old
You are Free
You are Free Indeed
You have the Victory by Faith
So put your Trust in Me.
You are Free
You are Free Indeed
You have the Victory by Faith
So put your Trust in Me.
You are Free Indeed
You have the Victory by Faith
So put your Trust in Me.
