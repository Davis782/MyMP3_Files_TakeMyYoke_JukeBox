Song Title: Ocean Waves
Artist: The Wanderers
Album: Nature's Symphony
Year: 2023

Verse 1:
Waves crash on the shore tonight
Under stars that shine so bright
Salt air fills my lungs with peace
As the tide brings sweet release

Chorus:
Ocean waves, carry me home
Through the seas where I roam
Every wave brings something new
Under skies of deepest blue

Verse 2:
Seabirds glide on gentle breeze
Dancing with the evening seas
Stories in the sand below
Secrets that the ocean knows

[Bridge]
Let the current take control
Let the ocean heal my soul
In this moment, I am free
One with sky and one with sea

(Repeat Chorus)
