Lord you are my Salvation
Lord you are my Light
Lord you are my Refuge
Understanding You is A Delight
You place my feet upon a Rock in the morning
You make straight paths for my feet
You keep me from the enemies, who regard not your majesty
You comfort me in the night watch
You give me rest and sleep
Oh Lord, How much I thank you
For You are the King of Kings
Lord you are my Salvation
Lord you are my Light
Lord you are my Refuge
Understanding You is A Delight
You place my feet upon a Rock in the morning
You make straight paths for my feet
You keep me from the enemies, who regard not your majesty
You comfort me in the night watch
You give me rest and sleep
Oh Lord, How much I thank you
For You are the King of Kings
Oh Lord, How much I thank you
For You are the King of Kings
