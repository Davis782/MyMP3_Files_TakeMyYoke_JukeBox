Song Title: Forest Rain
Artist: The Wanderers
Album: Nature's Symphony
Year: 2023

Verse 1:
Raindrops falling through the trees
Nature's gentle symphony
Green leaves glistening in the light
Making everything feel right

Chorus:
Forest rain, wash away
All my troubles of today
Every drop a healing sound
Peace in nature can be found

Verse 2:
Mist rising from the ground
Life awakening all around
Ancient trees stand tall and strong
While we sing our forest song

[Bridge]
In this moment, time stands still
As the rain falls on the hill
Nature's wisdom shows the way
On this perfect rainy day

(Repeat Chorus)
