Artist: The Wanderers
Album: Nature's Symphony
Year: 2023

Verse 1:
Standing on the mountain peak
Watching as the new day breaks
Golden light upon my face
Finding peace in nature's grace

Chorus:
In these mountain dreams
Nothing's what it seems
Every breath I take
Shows me what's at stake
In these mountain dreams

Verse 2:
Valley stretches down below
Painted by the morning glow
Every step along this trail
Tells another mountain tale

[Bridge]
Higher and higher we climb
Leaving our worries behind
Nature shows us the way
On this perfect mountain day

(Repeat Chorus)
